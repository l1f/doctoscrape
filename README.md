# doctoscrape

## The state of the project
This project is far from done and at my level of procrastinating everything, i guess it will never reach a usable state.

## What is this?
Sometimes I need doctors appointments in specialized places, but i don't want open doctolib every five minutes to check if there are open slots.

So here we are, with doctoscrape it is possible to create jobs, thats checks the doctolib api for appointments. Or at least this is the idea.

## Is there a public instance that i can use?

NO. And i don't ever host one.

I don't want deal with user data and I don't want responsible hosting any medicaldata. Ever. 

This project is created because of the desperated need of specific appointments.

For the same reason i don't provide relases or some promise of stability.
